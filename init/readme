Well.... I hope this doesn't end badly....

Here's what I did:
- created a ready_queue and 6 blocked queues, and methods to add/get the processId for the next avail process
- a process structure (based on the one they defined in the dummy test process)
- and as Ishy requested, push and pop methods for the stack in the processes

What I didn't do:
- error checking (boundary checking and etc.), dont see a point in doing that until I know my code is logically correct.
