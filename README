merge.py:           The python script to merge two .s19 files
mlight.s19:         The merged rtx_loader.s19 and rtx_test_light.s19 file. 
                    Timer1 interrupt is not enabled
rtx_loader.s19:     The rtx loader .s19 file
rtx_test_light.s19: The light weight testing process .s19 file. 
                    Two testing cases are included.

rtx_test_light.lst: the disassembled light weight test processes code

*How to merge mlight.s19 with your RTX?

1. compile your RTX and generate rtx.s19 file
2. merge your rtx.s19 file with mlight.s19 file and name it, say Gid_rtx.s19

*How to run the merged file (i.e. Gid_rtx.s19)?

1. download Gid_rtx.s19 to the board
2. type "go 10200000"

*Sample output:

janusROM> go 10200000
